# Portfolio

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

I specifically wanted to work with Angular for this project because it is the framework I've used at work the most, but this time I got the chance to see an Angular project start from scratch and practice a bit on Anuglar upgrades. Additionally, it gave me a chance to revist and practice CSS styling since at work I rarely need to use styling outside what is available in Bootstrap.

Even though it's overkill for such a small site, I'd like to add Cypress tests similar to those I've written at work so that I can have the chance to work through that setup process on my own.
